# hex-calculator

A simple calculator for converting hexadecimal to decimal numbers, and vice versa. This project is hosted on Cloudflare Workers, and is written in Rust and client-side JavaScript.

There are probably thousands of calculators like this on the internet, this is just a toy implementation because I've always wanted to make my own.
